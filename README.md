# Veer
Veer is a siderbar for implementing interactive plugins and widgets. These plugins act similarily to desktop widgets on Windows(TM), or iOS 8 NC Widgets.

## Usage
Veer is written in python, and can be ran using the python interpeter.

## Status/Stage
Veer is currently in very early active development, and has limited support, if any. There are many features that still need to be designed and implemented. The main purpose for me putting this barely started project on GitHub, is that I use different computers to work on the project.

## Dependencies
 * pygtk
 * gtk
 * cairo

## Creators & Contributors
This project was created by Samuel Steele (Cryptoc1) and there are currently no contributors.
